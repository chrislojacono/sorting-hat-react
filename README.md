# Sorting Hat built with React.js
The user should be able to type in a name and the name will be sorted to a random hogwarts house. Users can expel students of their choice as well.

## The Motivation

We had done this exercise in the front-end portion of NSS, using a single page JS file, so a classmate and I decided to rebuild it with React.js as practice while we worked through the back-end curriculum and learned C#.
